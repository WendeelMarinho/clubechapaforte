## Installation Process

1. **Upload Files**: Transfer all files to your website's root directory.
2. **Access the URL**: Navigate to the URL where you've uploaded the files. You should encounter an installation screen.
3. **Follow On-Screen Instructions**: Complete the steps as prompted to install the script.

**Important:** Once installed, log in using the admin credentials at <u>example.com/en-us/admin</u>. As an admin, you'll have the capability to create partners, allowing them to generate loyalty cards and rewards. Remember, don't install the script in a subdirectory like `example.com/loyalty`. Instead, use a subdomain, e.g., `loyalty.example.com`.

### Localhost Installation

For local environment setups, utilize Laravel's built-in `artisan serve` command:

```php artisan serve```

## Upgrading

### Check Your Current Version

To determine your current version, sign in as an admin at <u>example.com/en-us/admin</u>. The version number is displayed on the dashboard. You can also refer to the `version.txt` file included in the provided zip file.

## Upgrade Procedure

**1. Locate the Upgrade Files**: In the provided zip file, navigate to the `upgrade` directory. Here, you'll find zip files named in the format `upgrade-x.x.x-to-[version].zip`. 

**2. Determine the Correct File**: Identify the upgrade file that matches your current script version. If your script's version is older than the one indicated in the zip filename, you're eligible for the upgrade.

**3. Extract and Overwrite**: Unzip the contents of the appropriate `upgrade-x.x.x-to-[version].zip` and overwrite the existing files in your script's web root directory.

**Note**: Start the extraction process from the zip file that matches your current version. For example, if you have version `1.6.1`, begin with the `upgrade-1.6.x-to-[version].zip` file. Subsequently, extract all the zip files in ascending order of their version numbers.

#### Example

Imagine you have the following files in the `upgrade` directory:

 - upgrade-1.x.x-to-1.6.0.zip
 - upgrade-1.6.x-to-1.6.1.zip

If your current version is `1.2.0` and you aim to upgrade to `1.6.1`, start by unzipping `upgrade-1.x.x-to-1.6.0.zip`, then `upgrade-1.6.x-to-1.6.1.zip`.

But, if you're already on version `1.6.0`, you only need to extract `upgrade-1.6.x-to-1.6.1.zip`.

### Database Update

**1. Log In**: After updating the files, log in as an admin at <u>example.com/en-us/admin</u>.

**2. Look for Update Prompt**: If your database requires an update, a message will show: **"An update is required for your database. Click here to apply the update."**. Click on this prompt to carry out the necessary database updates.

Always check for database synchronization after every upgrade. Non-updated database migrations could lead to functional issues or errors.

#### Troubleshooting the 500 Error

If you face a 500 error after clicking on the database update link:

1. **Check the Log**: Refer to the `storage/logs/laravel.log` for detailed error information.

2. **Review PHP FPM Settings**: Within the PHP directives, find `disable_functions`. This directive lists all deactivated PHP functions on your server.

3. **Adjust Settings**: If `proc_open` and `proc_close` are listed, remove them. Make sure to save the changes, which might resolve the 500 error.

## Troubleshooting

Ensure to review the log file, which can be found at `logs/laravel.log`.
